# NewMind AI BootCamp ðŸŒ±

This repository is part of my learning journey through the **NewMindAI Bootcamp**, a program focused on deepening knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence and modern software development practices.

##  About Me In This Project ðŸ§ 

As a participant, I'm using this space to document what I learn, build hands-on projects, and reflect on key insights from the bootcamp. The goal is to grow through practical work, thoughtful experimentation, and collaboration with peers.
